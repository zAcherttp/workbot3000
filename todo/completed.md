- [x] Add troubleshooting section
- [x] Include example configurations
- [x] Document the new Google GenAI integration

## üéØ Next Steps

The project foundation is now complete. The next phase should focus on:

1. **Environment Setup**: Creating tsconfig.json, package.json scripts, and .env.example
2. **Core Implementation**: Starting with type definitions and utility functions
3. **Discord Integration**: Implementing basic bot functionality and user monitoring
4. **Game Detection**: Building the dual monitoring system (presence + process)
5. **API Integration**: Connecting to Gemini API for quote generation
